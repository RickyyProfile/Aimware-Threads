cheat.SetAntiAimLeft() -- read above
cheat.SetResolverAngle(EulerAngles) -- bruteforce resolver because im full
cheat.SetPeeking(boolean) -- make it so we can tell the fakelag we are currently peeking
textures inside gui.Custom
some type of built in cryptolib like Base64, AES or MD5, Since making those functions in lua is extremely slow.
GuiObject:GetSize() / GetBound?
GuiObject:SetCallback() returns integer, string, boolean when ever a GuiObject value was changed
access to IEffects, IViewRenderBeams and GlowObjectManager
3d rendering api (boxes, wireframe boxes, models etc)
ability to draw 2d elements(ex. draw.FilledRect) in 3d space
Make client.GetConVar output a integer anywhere it can and not a string bcs the majority of convars are just numbers
wait(5)
print("waited 5 seconds before printing this")
function: change CViewSetup .x, .y, .z
possible to use fontflags trough lua
access to debugoverlay so we can draw 3d boxes and lines
-This function returns aimbot target before ragebot fires
rbot.preFire(target, hitgroup, hitchance, damage)
target -- Returns entity index of target
hitgroup -- Returns hitgroup that the aimbot will shoot at
hitchance -- Returns hitchance that the aimbot calculated
damage -- Returns damage that the aimbot calculated
-Returns informations of shots that ragebot hit
rbot.Hit(target, hitgroup, hitchance, backtrack, damage, damage_s, x, y, z)
target -- Returns entity index of target
hitgroup-- Returns hitgroup that the aimbot hit
hitchance -- Returns hitchance that the aimbot calculated
backtrack -- Returns true if target was backtracked else false
damage -- Returns damage that the aimbot calculated
damage_s -- Returns actual damage that server registered for the shot
x, y, z -- XYZ position of the target
-Returns informations of shots that ragebot missed
rbot.Miss(target, hitgroup, hitchance, backtrack, damage, x, y, z)
get chat string from uid [/li]
RadarBuilder callback that can control what entities should be drawn in radar, and give ability to change color of dots in radar.
http.Fetch & http.Post (like in gLua eg @ wiki.garrysmod.com)
PlayerInfo Api
Input.IsCapsOn()
More access to engine functions (like getting cvars, latency, lowerbody angles)
Ability to change text size, font and weight (bold, light, regular.etc, should be dynamic based on the font)
Ability to import custom text fonts (would be a good idea combined with the http library for downloading them in the first place)
Ability to hook onto cheat-specific events, like when the aimbot shoots, changes targets, even UI element value changes, the more the better
Ability to set the value of checkboxes, edit boxes, and dynamically fill the combo box elements' contents by using a table where the key is the name the end-user sees on the GUI and value is the value returned via the API
Ability to retrieve the port of which the current game server is running on.
Ability to get/set friend option from pList ( using SteamID or name, possibly using wildcards i.e. all friends have ¢ in name, ignore all players with that character, or clantags, etc )
Ability to interact with the player list,adding buttons to it, or at least being able to check who you have as priority / friendly.
Ability to know when the cheat uses autodirection and in which side it is active.
Ability to read input from the aimware console
Being able to set settings per player, like visuals or legitbot settings, this would go well with the previous suggestion to be able to set different settings based on priority on the playerlist, or for simpler things like health based chams
Responsive group box elements
Ability to draw debug models and hitboxes https://imgur.com/6b2iyLY
It would be nice to have a function which returns an array containing the names of all the available config vars.
AimbotTarget callback should also return the angles it pretends to aim at or the absOrigin it pretends to aim at
E:SetProp only accepts two arguments as of now so doing E:SetProp("a", "b", 25) isn't possible
Animstate class to resolver builder
Allow access to resolver and anti-aim api
get tickbase & get simulation time
read netvars properly , change font and size
RadarBuilder callback that can control what entities should be drawn in radar, and give ability to change color of dots in radar.
grab the forum username of the current user to store as a variable
a way to convert tables to json & vice versa
Being able to reference the Skin changer Window
allow us to get the direction the player is looking at with his mouse, which can differ from the real and fake angles.
access to gradients in surface
The events player_chat and player_say are only triggered on non-dedicated servers.
Make gui.Text automatically break a new line instead of having it go out of the menu
have a function to check if certain vguiPanel is visible
Pitch Editing
Access to the fake model would be cool.
